# Maze-Generator
Maze Generator by kirillhalf3 and daggag

Maze Generator, as I think, is a very useful program. Imagine guests came to your house and their child of 5-6 years old came with them. You sit quietly and play something, and then your mother or one of your parents calls you to say hello to you graciously greeted them with guests and mom asks you to play with their child and you want to play PC quietly and if you just go with the child and sit down to play further, then the child will naturally also want to play on the PC
then maze generator comes to the rescue, you just open the program with the code, run it and wait until the maze is generated
then you make a screenshot
and print out a sheet with a maze and the child calmly goes through the maze and you play. I gave an example use of my program and I think it can be used in many other situations
